Class Nanobot:
    // ===== Fields =====
    // The nanobot object
    Gameobject NanobotPrefab

    // The controller of THIS nanobot
    NanobotController nanobotController

    // Flag to move object
    bool isMoving

    // Flag for nanobot controller to know that this nanobot is doing something
    public isExecutingCommand

    // Flag for whether THIS nanobot is locked
    bool isLocked

    // Targets for moving command
    Vector3 targetCoordinates
    Quaternian targetOrientation

    // Constants for speed
    float moveSpeed = 12f
    flaot rotateSpeed = 12f



    // ===== Methods =====
    // Comes with unity
    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        if (isMoving && !isLocked)
        {
            if (Transform.xyz = targetCoordinates && Transform.Orientation = targetOrientation)
            {
                isMoving = False
                isExecutingCommand = False
                return
            }

            Transform.xyz += moveSpeed
            transform.rotatoin += rotateSpeed

        }
    }

    // Will move to the given coordinates and rotation to the given orientation
    void move(Vector3 Coordiantes, Quaternian Orientation)
    {
        isExecutingCommand = true
        targetCoordinates = coordinates
        targetOrientation = Orientation
        isMoving = true
    }

    // Instantiates a new nanobot and notifies controller

        isExecutingCommand = true
        newNanobot = Instantiate(NanobotPrefab)
        nanobotController.registerNanobot(newNanobot)
        isExecutingCommand = false  // This is actually pointless here since i'm not doing async yet
    }

    // Will use rays to find adjacent nanobots to lock with
    // When locked nanobot can't move
    void lock()
    {
        - Find adjacent nanobots
        - Lock with nanobots that are 'touching' and 'orientated' correctly (that is parallel)
        - notify any nanobots that were locked
    }



Class NanobotController:
    // ===== Fields =====
    // The nanobot object
    Gameobject NanobotPrefab

    // The nanobots that the controller knows about
    // Instead of the nanobot reference itself, maybe it will go to a struct with necessary info on nanobot (including it's reference)
        - This depends more on how the blueprint will be structured and how the controller will use it
    Set<Nanobot> avaliableNanobots

    // Blueprints to create
    Queue<Blueprint> blueprintToCreate
    Blueprint currentBlueprint = null

    // Keep track of the blueprints created and the nanobots that are composed of it
    // Maybe not a literal list of blueprints, but blueprint info???
    list<Blueprints> blueprintsCreated

    // Constants for nanobot thresholds
    int minimumNanobots
    float percentageToReplicate
    float percentageToMove

    // May Be necessary for keeping track of nanobots
    // Not sure if a list is necessary
    - replicatingNanobotsCount
    - movingNanobotsCount
    - etc





    // ===== Methods =====
    // Method form unity
    // Note: this may not be the best place for this - will mess around with it in unity
    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        - Check if blueprint is being made, and if not, get one from queue if avaliable
        - If blueprint is being made
            - if no nanobots are avaliable then create one
            - assignNanobots()
        - otherwise remain idle (at this point the program is done for now) 
    }

    // Creates a nanobot
    void createNanobot()
    {
        newNanobot = Instantiate(NanobotPrefab)
        registerNanobot(newNanobot)
    }

    // Registers a nanobot to THIS controller
    void registerNanobot(Nanobot newNanobot)
    {
        // Note may be nanobot information itself
        avaliableNanobots.add(newNanobot)
    }

    void assignNanobots()
    {
        // Note: This will be slow since not doing async yet
        - Create nanobots till minimum threshold (or until necessary amount for BP is met)
        - assign % of nanobots to replicate (if necessary)
        - Move nanobots
        - Lock nanobots when nanobot reaches destination
        - if nanobots are all locked (that is BP is completed)
            - currentBlueprint = null
    }



Struct nanobotInformation
{
    // ===== Fields =====
    - unique ID
    - NanobotReference
    - Status
    - relatedBlueprint
}



// Notes:
    - blueprint will contain all the positions and orientations (transforms) of where the nanobots should be
Class Blueprint
    // ===== Fields =====
    - list<Transform> nanobotTargets
    - targetCenter (the relative position to the nanobot targets)
    - list<blueprint> dependencies (tree structure) 
        >> Will complete leaves of the tree first
    - totalDependencies (number of dependecies of the whole tree [going down]) - could be useful

    // ===== Methods =====



// Notes:
    - The blueprint data will be all the necessary 'variable' bits of the blueprint that need to be used
    - Will also include the literal blueprint itself
Struct BlueprintData
    // ===== Fields =====
    - Unique ID
    - Blueprint reference (the literal blueprint to construct)
    - Status
    - relatedNanobotsIds (apart of blueprint)
    - Blueprint position (blueprint position in world - relative to nanobotcontroller)
    - Blueprint orientation (blueprint orientation in world - relative to nanobotcontroller)
    - current blueprint tree (where you are in the blueprint tree)
